## Lichtzeitpegel
is the name of the clock light sculpture by the artist Horst H. Baumann on the Rhine tower of Düsseldorf. It was put into operation on November 24, 1981, and it is the largest decimal "time scale" in the world according to the Guinness Book of Records.

## SetTime
With the included Program ´TowerClock - SetTime´ the time of the TowerClock can be reset.
By executing ´TowerClockSetTime.exe´ the program is started. Just follow the instructions on the screen.
The program uses the computers system time and syncs the TowerClock to it. Also, the Program is only compiled for use with Windows.

FYI: The TowerClock might restart in the connection process.
